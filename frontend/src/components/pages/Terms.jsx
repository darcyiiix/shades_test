We try our very best to stick to the advertised delivery dates; however, as all our lampshades are handmade to order, our lead time may fluctuate depending on the number of orders we receive each week.</p>

            <p>Please note that we are a UK-based company making lampshades to fit all UK and EU lamp bases and flex sets. If you are based outside the UK, it is your responsibility to ensure our lampshades will fit your lamp. Our lampshades will not fit American-style harp fittings or lamp bases requiring a carrier. We do have options for you, so please get in touch with your requirements if you are unsure.</p>

            <h1 className="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Changes to European Shipping:</h1>

            <p>Etsy is registered for IOSS (Import One Stop Shop). The IOSS allows Love Frankie to sell goods to buyers in the EU. Etsy will collect, declare, and pay the VAT to the tax authorities on all EU orders, instead of making you, the buyer, pay the VAT at the time the goods are imported into the EU as was previously the case.</p>
                <br></br>
            <p>The VAT for each EU country will be charged in accordance with the Global VAT compliance for each EU member state. For full details on each country's VAT rate and shipping charges, please contact Etsy directly.</p>
                <br></br>
            <p>Please note: IOSS has been introduced for low-level shipments across Europe and is only available for orders valued at 150 Euros or less. Orders over 150 Euros will incur additional VAT and customs duties upon delivery, so please keep your order under 150 Euros!</p>
